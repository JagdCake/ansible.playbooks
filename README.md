### Description
My [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks, used mainly for automating the set up and maintenance of a CentOS 7 VPS.

### Current state
[vultr](./vultr) playbooks are what I'm focused on. Tested on a virtual machine and used on a production server, still have some things to work out.
